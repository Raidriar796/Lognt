# Logn't
 
A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows for disabling all logs, warnings, and errors from being written to disk.

## Notice

This mod is situational. Logs with mods already cannot be submitted for bug reports, but this mod will also prevent the ability to diagnose issues with mods too. If you're experiencing an issue, first and foremost disable all mods. If you're confident or have confirmed an issue is related to a mod, submit bug reports including logs with logging enabled.

For a better general solution, [LogCleaner](https://github.com/art0007i/LogCleaner) is a good option
